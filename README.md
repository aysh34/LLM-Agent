## Overview

LLM-Agent is a reference project for building intelligent agents powered by large language models. It focuses on practical patterns for structuring reasoning loops, managing memory, integrating external tools, and composing modular capabilities. The repository is organized to let you start simple and iteratively add sophistication.

## Key Features

- Goal-oriented agent design with configurable memory backends
- Iterative reasoning / action loops
- Tool and API integration layer (extensible registry pattern)
- Modular prompts and prompt templates
- Clear separation between core logic, utilities, and experimental notebooks
- Example workflows to accelerate adaptation

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ (recommend using a virtual environment)
- Access keys for any external LLM or tool APIs you plan to use
- (Optional) Jupyter for exploratory development

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aysh34/LLM-Agent.git
    cd LLM-Agent
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    # Windows
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    # macOS / Linux
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install dependencies
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Create a .env file (example)
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
    OTHER_SERVICE_KEY=optional_key
    ```
    Add any additional keys required by tools you enable.

5. Run the baseline agent
    ```bash
    python agent.py
    ```
