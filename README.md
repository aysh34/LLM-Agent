## Overview

LLM-Agent is a reference project for designing and implementing intelligent agents powered by large language models (LLMs). It focuses on practical patterns for goal-driven behavior, iterative reasoning, memory management, and safe interaction with external tools. The repository is organized to let you start small and extend capabilities incrementally.

## Key Capabilities

- Goal-oriented agent loop with configurable reasoning depth
- Pluggable memory (short‑term, long‑term, and contextual buffers)
- Tool and API integration via a clean abstraction layer
- Prompt templating for consistent instruction patterns
- Modular architecture to add skills, evaluators, and guards
- Example workflows and notebooks for experimentation

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ (recommend a dedicated virtual environment)
- Access credentials for any external APIs you intend to enable
- (Optional) Jupyter for exploratory development

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aysh34/LLM-Agent.git
    cd LLM-Agent
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (example):
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Configure environment:
    - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (if provided) or create `.env`.
    - Add required API keys (e.g., OPENAI_API_KEY=...).
    - Adjust any config constants under `agents/` or `utils/` as needed.

5. Run a sample agent:
    ```bash
    python agent.py
    ```

## Usage

- Adjust agent strategy: edit or add modules in `agents/` (planning, reflection, tool selection).
- Customize prompts: update templates in `prompts/` to refine style or constraints.
- Extend tools: implement new tool wrappers in `utils/` and register them with the agent.
- Experiment: use `notebooks/` to prototype reasoning chains, memory policies, or evaluation routines.

## Extending the Agent

- New reasoning step: add a module exposing a function/class invoked in the loop.
- New memory backend: implement a storage interface and register it.
- New tool: wrap the external capability with validation and rate limiting.
- Evaluation: create a harness notebook to compare reasoning variants.

## Testing

If tests are added (e.g., under `tests/`):
```bash
pytest -q
```
Consider adding unit tests for memory boundary cases and tool invocation safety.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome:
- Open an issue for bugs, design questions, or feature proposals.
- Keep pull requests focused and include concise rationale.
- Follow existing code style; prefer small, composable functions.
