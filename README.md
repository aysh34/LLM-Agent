## Overview

LLM-Agent is a project that demonstrates how to build intelligent agents using large language models. The goal is to provide a clear and practical guide for creating agents that can reason, remember, and interact with tools. The project is structured to help users understand the core concepts and gradually build more advanced systems.

## Features

- Agent design based on goals and memory
- Reasoning loops for decision making
- Integration with external tools and APIs
- Modular architecture for extensibility
- Example workflows and use cases

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aysh34/LLM-Agent.git
    cd LLM-Agent
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Configure your environment:**
    - Set up API keys for any external services in a `.env` file.
    - Adjust configuration files as needed for your use case.

4. **Run the agent:**
    ```bash
    python agent.py
    ```

## Usage

- Modify the agent configuration to set goals and memory parameters.
- Add or update reasoning modules to change how the agent makes decisions.
